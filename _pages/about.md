I am a PhD student in Computational Chemistry at the [French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS)](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) / [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/), under the supervision of [Guillaume Maurin](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=QNfwyjgAAAAJ&hl=fr). In parallel, I work as a research engineer at [TotalEnergies](https://www.totalenergies.fr/) in the CO2 and Sustainability R&D division at the [Centre Scientifique et Technique Jean-Féger](https://cstjf-pau.totalenergies.fr/en/our-sites/cstjf), supported by the [CIFRE](https://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/le-dispositif-cifre-7844) fellowship program and supervised by [Yann Magnin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h4F2hygAAAAJ&hl=fr). While my doctoral research is primarily computational, I closely collaborate with the [IMAP](https://www.ens.psl.eu/laboratoire/institut-des-materiaux-poreux-de-paris-imap) experimental lab, led by [Christian Serre](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=SZPA59YAAAAJ&hl=en), to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Before starting my PhD, I spent four years as a researcher at the Tata Research Development and Design Centre, the flagship innovation lab of [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research) in Pune, India. In this role, I led and contributed to both independent and collaborative research projects, provided R&D consultancy to clients, developed innovative assets, and mentored interns. I had the opportunity to work closely with a diverse range of industries, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food and beverages, and paints, fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations and driving impactful solutions.

I completed my Master's in Chemical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), where I was supervised by [Jayant K. Singh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UDr7tjEAAAAJ&hl=en), and my Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering from [Jadavpur University](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/).

Research Interests
======
<div style="text-align: right">
I am currently focused on studying Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for gas separations using advanced computational techniques. My research leverages a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and machine learning to discover, design, and optimize MOFs and MOF-polymer composites for industrially relevant applications. More broadly, I am interested in the adsorption and transport of gases in nanoporous materials, and how detailed microscopic insights from simulations can be harnessed to engineer improved materials for energy and environmental solutions.

In my previous role at TRDDC, I focused on integrating molecular dynamics and machine learning to predict the thermodynamic properties and biological activities of small organic molecules. I also developed high-throughput cheminformatics pipelines to streamline virtual screening processes, improving efficiency and accuracy. During my Master's, I performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the structural and thermodynamic behavior of drug-lipid-polymer systems, gaining valuable insights into their interactions, stability, and potential applications.
